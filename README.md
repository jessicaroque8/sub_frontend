# sub_frontend
A frontend client (Angular 5 and Ionic 3) for a mobile app to manage class instructor substitute requests for users of the MINDBODY business software.

To set up local emulation:
1. Install dependencies as needed:
  * Node.js (https://nodejs.org/en/)
  * Ionic and Cordova CLI
    `$ npm install -g cordova ionic`
  * Xcode (https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/xcode/id497799835?mt=12)
2. Install the Node package dependencies.
   `$ npm install`
3. For iOS, emulate the Ionic Project using Simulator.
   `$ ionic cordova emulate ios`
4. For Android, emulate the Ionic Project.
   `$ ionic cordova emulate android`
4. Refer to your MINDBODY Sandbox's class schedule to identify staff you can create accounts for and classes that you can create requests for.
   * _Note:_ When prompted for their MINDBODY username and password, you may use any values for these. Their first and last name will identify them in the system.
